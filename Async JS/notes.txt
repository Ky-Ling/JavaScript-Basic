1: AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
     When we are using AJAX, it is sending some kind of requests to a server and that server gets back 
        to the information and the format. And we take that JSON format that contains all the data, we 
        turn that and parse it into JavaScript usable code and then we just update the information on 
        the screen.  

2: Callback function:
    A function that is passed in as a parameter and that is gonna run later on in a later time

3: Promise:
    A promise is just an object that basically gives us back either a result of an asynchronous operation or a failure of asynchronous
    operation
